# Cisco Packet Tracer Activities Repository

Welcome to my **Cisco Packet Tracer Activities** repository! This repository showcases my skills and knowledge in networking concepts, specifically in designing and simulating LAN and WAN infrastructures using Cisco Packet Tracer. Each activity highlights various network configurations and protocols commonly used in the industry.

---

## **Repository Overview**

This repository contains several Packet Tracer files (`.pkt`) demonstrating the following networking setups:

### **Routing**
1. **Static Routing**  
   - Configured manual routes for a basic network infrastructure.
2. **Dynamic Routing**  
   - Implemented protocols like OSPF and EIGRP for automated route updates.
3. **EIGRP for 9 Routers**  
   - A robust setup showcasing advanced EIGRP configurations.

### **Network Services**
1. **DHCP**  
   - Automated IP address allocation across different network segments.
2. **TFTP and Backup Recovery**  
   - File transfer and recovery processes for device configurations.
3. **DHCP with TFTP Integration**  
   - Combined DHCP with TFTP to demonstrate centralized configuration management.

### **Access Control and Management**
1. **ACL (Access Control Lists)**  
   - Enforced security by restricting traffic based on predefined rules.
2. **Telnet Configuration**  
   - Remote access to network devices for management and troubleshooting.

## **How to Use**

1. **Prerequisites**  
   - Cisco Packet Tracer (Version 8.0 or above recommended).  

2. **Steps to Open a File:**  
   - Clone or download the repository.  
   - Open any `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
   - Simulate, analyze, and modify as per your requirements.
